    <h2 align="middle">Progress So Far</h2>
    <p>
      We split our progress into two main parts. The first is radiance mapping and the second is tone mapping.
    </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Radiance Map Reconstruction (Debevec)</h3>
    <p>
      In this section, we implemented Debevec’s Algorithm to “fuse the multiple photographs into a single, high dynamic range radiance map whose pixel values are proportional to the true radiance values in the scene”. There are three functions for the Debevec’s Algorithm: <code>response_function</code> for sampling the pixels from images with different exposure times, <code>response_function_solver</code> for finding the response curve and <code>construct_radiance_map</code> for constructing the radiance map from the response curves.</p>
<p>In <code>response_function</code>, we set up the parameters we need for <code>response_function_solver</code>. The <code>ln_t</code> is the log shutter speed in Equation (2). The <code>l</code> is the lambda constant to determine the smoothness. The <code>w</code> is the weighting function to “emphasize the smoothness and fitting terms toward the middle of the curve”. The <code>Z</code> is a 2D array storing the pixel values of all images. We sample <code>num_samples * num_samples</code> pixels equally across each image. Now we can call <code>response_function_solver</code> to solve the response function.</p>
In <code>response_function_solver</code>, we followed the Matlab implementation in the paper to solve the linear system that minimize the objective function O in Equation (3). Because it is quadratic in the Ei and g(z)’s, minimizing O is a linear least square problem which can be solved using singular value decomposition (SVD). The function returns the log exposure corresponding to pixel z in Equation (2).</p>
<p>In <code>construct_radiance_map</code>, we calculate the radiance value at each pixel according to Equation (6), where <code>g</code> is the function returned by
<code>response_function</code>, and <code>w</code> is the weighting function
described by Equation (4). We return the radiance map as a 2D-array with the same dimensions as the original image.
    </p>


    <h3 align="middle">Local Tone Mapping (Durand)</h3>
    <p>
      In this section, we implemented local tone mapping to be able to show off our image cleanly. The idea behind the tone map is to take
      a high dynamic range and map it to the limited range of the screen, but take advantage of the entire range of the screen.
    </p>

    <p>
      We implemented this mostly through a single function called <code>local_tone_mapping</code>. This function takes in a radiance map and a given dynamic range and returns
      the tone mapped image. Our steps are to:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Calculate the intensity by averaging channels.</li>
      <li>Compute chrominance channels.</li>
      <li>Calculate the log intensity of the pixels, controlling for potential zeroes.</li>
      <li>Apply a bilateral filter. Note that this bilateral filter is currently implemented using a built-in library function. We may reimplement this function later on.</li>
      <li>Compute the difference between the log intensity and the bilateral filtering as the detail layer</li>
      <li>Scale it to the given dynamic range using max-min normalization and redo the log intensity</li>
      <li>Use the chrominance channels to add back the colors</li>
      <li>Take the square root of everything in order to lighten the image</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      So far, we are able to tone map images and see a small but meaningful difference in viewing quality. You can see more on the slides.
    </p>
    <h2 align="middle">Progress Relative to Plan</h2>
    <p>
      In our original plan, we planned to set up our codebase, implement Debevec's algorithm, and implement a way to turn
      a radiance map into viewables images. The only part of our Week 2 plan we did not completely finish was creating a pipeline for applying
      this method on our own images. However, this pipeline is basically coded up; we just need to figure out a few debugging areas
      and make it easier to specify program arguments instead of hardcoding image paths.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a result, we will update our plan to finish the pipeline in Week 3. Everything else will remain the same.
    </p>
